# Collector

Collector is a tool for adding some data to my various database tables in the hopes of using the data in a cool way later, but first someone has to collect all of the details that make up the data. Day one will likely be forms to collect data and viewing lists, and day two will be ingesting data from files and other sources... and then we should have a nice mess of data to play with.

Collector. Go get what you like and _collect_ it.
