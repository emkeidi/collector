# Collector

A solution grown from the desire for a simple way to add entries to specific tables of a database.

The Collector API will control insertions to a database.

The backend uses Java 21 and Spring Boot with Maven.

The first frontend client will be an Electron app written using TypeScript and React.

The database will be a relational database like MySQL to start simple and support speedy reads.

This won't be an overcomplicated setup, useful mainly for a clean way to keep my database updates rolling regularly. I'm sure tools like this exist aplenty, but this is also an excuse for me to build a baby app and consider whether web hosting wouldn't suit my needs better.

If I can find some desktop-only functionality, all the better.
